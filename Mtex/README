********* NAIST Thesis Template **********

This is a TeX template to use in compiling NAIST Master's or Doctors theses.

--- Preparation

Before you compile the thesis, you will have to install two programs:
1) platex
2) dvipdfmx

If you are on a Linux machine, you can install these both through the package manager for your system (for example apt-get for Ubuntu/Debian). If you are on Mac, they can both be installed using MacPorts or Brew.

--- Compiling

Once you have the files installed, you can compile the thesis by typing:
$ make
on the terminal.

You can probably also use your favorite LaTeX GUI editor, but you will have to set the program used in compilation to be "platex" and "dvipdfmx".

Older version of platex may bring text-encoding error. Try the latest version, or convert the encoding of *.tex and *.sty  files to EUC.
